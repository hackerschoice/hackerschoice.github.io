1. **My Question is not answered here**  
   Join our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/thcorg) and ask your question. We will try to answer.
1. **Why are my changes lost?**  
   Data in your home directory and in /sec, /onion and /everyone is permanent and wont get lost (unless you delete it). Data in (/usr, /tmp, ...) is only valid for the duration of the session and will disappear when you log out. Chances are that you used `apt install` and got a warning. You can use `apt install` but the package can only be used until you log out. Instead tell us and we will install the package to the core system and make it permanentally available. Alternativly you can install any package to `/sec/usr` and it wont get lost when you log out.

1. **Why do I get resource errors**  
   You likely got `out of heap memory`, `resource temporarily unavailable` or `Disk quota exceeded`. The FREE service is [restricted](../youcheapfuck). You can upgrade your server and [enjoy unlimited resources](../buy-an-upgrade).
