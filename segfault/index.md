### Log in

```shell
ssh root@segfault.net # The password is 'segfault'
```

### What it does

Segfault offers free unlimitd Root Servers. A new server (inside a Virtual Machine) is created for every SSH connection. 

* Dedicated ```Root Server``` for every user.
* Pre-installed tools on Kali-Linux.
* Traffic routed via NordVPN/CryptoStorm/ProtonVPN.
* Transparent TOR to connect to .onion addresses.
* Log in via ```.onion``` and ```gsocket```.
* Encrypted DNS traffic (DNS over HTTPS)
* Pre-configured .onion web server. Just put your files into /onion
* Encrypted storage in ```/sec``` and ```/home```. 
* Encrypted storage unmounts immediately after log out.
* Only the user can decrypt the data. We do not have access.
* No Logs.

**We don't give you root access to our server. We give you root access to your personal server.**
