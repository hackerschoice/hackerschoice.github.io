TOKENS give you more bandwidth, processing power, storage space and allow you to log in to your Root Server when there is a contention for resources (e.g. when under attack). 

TOKENS are available from the [SysCops](https://t.me/thcorg). Explain your project in the [channel](https://t.me/thcorg) if you need a TOKEN. See if the community is excited about your project. The SysCops will notice your fine work and will gift you a TOKEN. Otherwise, if you feel confident, you may disturb a SysCop by private message (you have been warned). TOKENS are not for sale. Here are a few tips who gets a TOKEN:

 * Participate in the discussions.
 * Share your ideas, comments and concerns.
 * Find bugs.
 * Projects that help the community.
 * Projects that are new and exciting.
 * Save the world.
 * Hacktivism & IT Security Research.

Segfault is not for Bug Bounty, Bots, Mining or hosting game servers.  

Upgrade your server with your secret TOKEN:
```sh
### Log in to your root server and type:
curl sf/set -d token=SecretTokenChangeMe && reboot
```

```sh
### Wait 30 seconds.
### Log back in to your Root Server and check the increased resources:
cat /config/self/limits
```
