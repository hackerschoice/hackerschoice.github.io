We run this service free of charge - it's how we like it to be. You have been using our service for a while now. We are no company. We do this in our own spare time.

If you like this service then please show your gratitude by joining our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/thcorg) and participate in our discussions. Share your ideas, your comments and your concerns. Tinker with us.

If you are a corporate or are using our service for commercial reasons or gain other financial benefits or favours then you are required to [donate some big dough](../upgrade).

The free servers have restrictions in place. The storage, memory, processing power and bandwidth is limited. When there is a squeeze for resources we may shut down 'free' servers. We may destroy the storage and data if the 'free' server is not being used for many weeks.

Consider to [upgrade your server](../upgrade) and get some neat benefits.

[Talk to us](https://t.me/thcorg) and there is a good chance that we will remove all restrictions from your server; especially if we like what you are working on.
