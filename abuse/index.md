## No Abuse

We do not tolarate abuse of our tools or services. Please contact us if you have any concern about abuse.

The tools we develop and services we provide are for research and eduational purposes only. They are meant to be used for good purposes.

THC is no place for mining-imbeciles, ransomware-idiots, DDoS-kiddos, revenge-hacking, greed, hate or criminal activites. We have no patience for this.
