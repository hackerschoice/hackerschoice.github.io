If you want to also share your internet to those who need it, just copy/paste this line in any page:

```html
<iframe src="https://snowflake.torproject.org/embed.html" width="320" height="240" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

## How it works

Tor / Snowflake will allow others living in countries where the internet access is restricted to access to the free internet while this tab is kept open.

Don't hesitate to read the [technical overview](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake/-/wikis/Technical%20Overview) to learn more about it.
